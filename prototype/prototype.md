Extension of existing Golang Weather Forecast program to perform correlation between Meterological Stations that provided Weather Forecast, PSI, Air temperature across Singapore and Stations that has TB1 Tipping Point Rain Gauge to measure Rain falls. Whether Forecast tells you the forecasted weather conditions across Singapore, but the accuracy depends on various factors and metrics. At times, it would be nice to know if rain has fall in the area. Rainfall readings from the rain gauge deployed across Singapore measures rain fall rate based on 0.2mm gauge in 5 mins interval. It is able to provide real-time situation on how heavy the rain in the area within 5mins interval. TB1 Rain Gauge is only not able to measure light rain, as 

This is still a prototype.
